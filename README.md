## Requirements
Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python: Version 3.7 or higher
- PostgreSQL: Version 9.6 or higher
- Node.js: Version 12+ (for web assets)
- NPM/Yarn: For building web assets
- Git: To clone the Odoo repository
- Pip: Python package installer
  
## Getting Started
Step 1: Clone the Odoo Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo.git
cd odoo
You can either use the official Odoo repository or your custom project repository if working with a specific project.

Step 2: Create a Python Virtual Environment
Itâ€™s a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate your Odoo environment.

```bash
python3 -m venv odoo-venv
source odoo-venv/bin/activate
```

Step 3: Install Python Dependencies
Install the required Python packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Step 4: Install PostgreSQL
Ensure that PostgreSQL is installed and running. You can install it using the package manager for your operating system (e.g., apt, yum, brew).

- To install on Ubuntu, for example:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install postgresql postgresql-server-dev-all
```
- Create a PostgreSQL user for Odoo:

```bash
sudo -u postgres createuser -s odoo
```
Step 5: Install Node.js Dependencies
Odoo uses Node.js for its web assets. 
- Install the necessary packages using either npm or yarn.

```bash
npm install -g less less-plugin-clean-css
npm install -g rtlcss
```
- If you are using yarn, install it and run:

```bash
yarn install
```
## Installation
Step 1: Configure Odoo
Create an Odoo configuration file:

```bash
cp odoo.conf.example odoo.conf
```
Modify the following fields in odoo.conf:

```ini

[options]
admin_passwd = admin
db_host = False
db_port = False
db_user = odoo
db_password = False
addons_path = addons,custom_addons
logfile = /var/log/odoo/odoo.log
admin_passwd: The master password for managing databases.
addons_path: Specify the path to your Odoo addons or custom modules.
logfile: The location of the Odoo log file.
```
Step 2: Build Web Assets (Optional)
If you're working on the web front-end and need to build web assets, use the following command:

```bash
./odoo-bin --dev=assets
```
## Running Odoo
- Once everything is installed and configured, you can run Odoo with the following command:

```bash
./odoo-bin -c odoo.conf
```
- Odoo will now run on http://localhost:8069.

- To specify a different port, modify the odoo.conf file or pass the --xmlrpc-port option:

```bash
./odoo-bin -c odoo.conf --xmlrpc-port=8070
```
- Accessing Odoo
Open your web browser and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:8069
```
You will be prompted to create a new database or select an existing one.

### Database Management
Creating a New Database
- Navigate to http://localhost:8069/web/database/manager.
- Click on "Create Database".
- Fill in the required fields:
Master Password: admin (as specified in odoo.conf).
Database Name: Choose a name for your database.
Email: Admin email for login.
Password: Admin password for login.
- Click "Create Database".
Managing Databases
You can manage databases using the Odoo database manager at:

```bash
http://localhost:8069/web/database/manager
```
Here, you can backup, restore, or delete databases.

## FAQ
How do I change the default port?
To change the default port, edit the odoo.conf file or run the following command:

```bash
./odoo-bin -c odoo.conf --xmlrpc-port=<desired_port>
```
How do I install custom modules?
- Place your custom modules in the custom_addons folder (or any folder specified in the addons_path).
- Update the module list:
Go to Apps > Update Apps List.
- Search for your custom module and install it.
How do I enable developer mode?
- To enable developer mode, append ?debug=1 to your URL:

```arduino
http://localhost:8069?debug=1
```
